# nixptsetup
A simple bash script that I use to setup and configure my Kali VM after a fresh installation for penetration testing related activities

The items below are the tasks that the script perform...

* Opening my five favorite Firefox addons (uBlock, Wappalyzer, Netcraft, Shodan, and FoxyProxy)
* Downloading Elliot Alderson's Mr. Robot wallpaper
* Downloading Evil-WinRM and Impacket into a folder called tools on the Desktop
* Installing Terminator terminal
* Adding useful aliases to the bash profile
* Installing some useful applications (Irssi, Bleachbit, Veil-Evasion, Cmatrix, and Geany)


**Running The Bash Script**
> $ sudo chmod +x nixptsetup.sh \
> $ ./nixptsetup.sh
